A robust Python implementation of chaos-based encryption using the Lorenz system and Plain Convolution Encryption (PCE). This project implements novel cryptographic methods that leverage chaos theory for secure communication, offering both addition and convolution-based encryption variants.

### Key Features
- 🔐 Chaos-based encryption using Lorenz system synchronization
- 🔄 Plain Convolution Encryption (PCE) implementation
- 🛡️ Enhanced security against Fourier analysis attacks
- 📊 Comprehensive testing and validation suite
- 📈 Visualization tools for encryption analysis

This repository implements the encryption methods from the paper "Plain Convolution Encryption as an Alternative to Overcoming the Limitations of Synchronization-Based Methods", demonstrating both theoretical foundations and practical applications in secure communication.

**Paper Reference:**

*   **Title:** Plain Convolution Encryption as an Alternative to Overcoming the Limitations of Synchronization-Based Methods
*   **Authors:** Flavio Rosales-Infante, M.L. Romero-Amezcua, Iván Álvarez-Rios, F. S Guzmán
*   **arXiv Link:** [https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03027v1](https://arxiv.org/abs/2504.03027v1)

## Requirements

*   Python (>= 3.10 recommended)
*   NumPy
*   SciPy
*   pytest (for running tests)
*   Matplotlib (optional, for visualizing results similar to the paper's figures)

A `requirements.txt` file is included for easy installation of dependencies.

## Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/ramsyana/lorenz-chaos-encrypt.git
    cd YOUR_REPOSITORY_NAME
    ```

2.  **Create and activate a virtual environment (recommended):**
    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows:
    # venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux:
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required packages:**
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Testing

This project uses `pytest` for unit testing. To run the tests:

1.  Make sure you are in the root directory of the project (where the `pytest.ini` or `pyproject.toml` file would be, or just the main project folder).
2.  Ensure your virtual environment is activated.
3.  Run the following command:

    ```bash
    pytest
    ```
    Or for more detailed output:
    ```bash
    pytest -v
    ```

The tests cover individual functions within the modules (`lorenz.py`, `messages.py`, `pce.py`, `hacking.py`, etc.) to ensure correctness based on the paper's algorithms and expected numerical behavior.
